# Probability Refresher
Toss a coin- you toss it once, you have no idea which is going to turn up.  
However, you know that there are only two possibilities. If the top coin is a fair coin, you should have roughly equal odds.   
This is a discrete event (each has an independent probabilty.  
> import random 
> randint(1,2)

## What about dice?
Assuming that it is a fair di, it should show 1/6 chance (16.66%). The question is, what happens if we throw the dice two times, and think of all the possible combinations and frequency and sum of each pair. This experiment is about tossing dice two times and seeing the outcome, each outcome seeing two dice. Then, thinking about the frequency of the sum of each pair.
