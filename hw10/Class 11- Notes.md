## Types of Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics: Statistics we have looked at so far
- Population & parameters: The population is everything within a group of things (ie the population of America is everyone in America, etc.)
- Sample & statistics: Sample is a subset of the population data
- Centrality: The quality of being in the middle of something. 
- Dispersion: The spread of the data (known as Range), also variance, and standard deviation. How much the data varies. Less when the numbers are closer together, more when the numbers are further apart.

## Inferential Statistics: 
We can only do sampling to get a smaller sample of the population data. We want to infer what the population parameter should be, based on our limited knowledge of the sample (ie a poll)
- Point/Internal estimate: How do we calculate the sample statistics, and be able to estimate the parameters of the data. If you relate to the election, the idea of a poll percentage to understand larger trends within the population. Margin of error for how different the sample could be from the truth .
> If we do a random sample of 100 colleges, and got the average tuition of that 100 colleges, can we say that the average cost of all colleges is X? How good is that estimate, and 
- Hypothesis testing: Comparing two things
> ex. Maryland has lower cost of education compared to Virginia. How would I prove this? Get data for all colleges in Maryland, and get data for all colleges in virginia, and then take the average of both, then compare them. Hypothesis, comparison, result. You could also take a smaller sample from Maryland and Virginia, and compare the two, to see whether or not. This is INTERENTIAL statistics.
