# Individual Project  (Part 1)
Find an issue that you are passionate about or are interested in as the topic for this exploratory data analysis project.  
Make sure there are publicly available data about this issue to perform exploratory analysis.  
The analysis should include descriptive statistics, data visualization, and optionally statistical inference.  

Dataset Intended: (US Education Datasets Unification Project)[https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project]

## Deliverable #1 - Project Proposal in Markdown format

Write and submit a research proposal in the **Markdown** format that answers the following questions:

1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
As I work in education, I have been interested in educational progress for students in the United States. 
Despite the obvious wealth of the US, as a country, there is much evidence suggesting that our educational attainment lacks in comparison to other countries.
In 2019, on the PISA tests, we ranked a tepid 36 out of 79 [Source](https://hechingerreport.org/what-2018-pisa-international-rankings-tell-us-about-u-s-schools/).
In this project, I will look at student achievement and potential issues. 

2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
What is compelling about the obvious question of the educational lag in performance is that the United States spends a great deal on education. From the NCES report in 2016, "The United States spent $13,600 per FTE student at the elementary/secondary level, which was 39 percent higher than the average of OECD countries3 reporting data ($9,800)" [source](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cmd.asp). 

3. What questions do you have in mind and wouyld like to answer?
4. Where do you get the data to help answer your questions? 
5. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units do you expect to analyze?
6. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis?
7. What kinds of techniques do you you plan to use (for example, summary statistics, scatter plot, bar chart, chi-squared test)? 

I will review your proposal and provide feedback before you start the actual work.
