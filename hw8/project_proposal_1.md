# UMBC DATA690: STATS AND VISUALIZATION (WANG)
## Hirabayashi Individual Project  (Part 1)

### Instructions
> Find an issue that you are passionate about or are interested in as the topic for this exploratory data analysis project.  
> Make sure there are publicly available data about this issue to perform exploratory analysis.  
> The analysis should include descriptive statistics, data visualization, and optionally statistical inference.

## Deliverable #1 - Project Proposal in Markdown format
Write and submit a research proposal in the **Markdown** format that answers the following questions:

### 1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
As I work in education, I have been interested in educational progress for students in the United States. 
Despite the obvious wealth of the US, as a country, there is much evidence suggesting that our educational attainment lacks in comparison to other countries.
In 2019, on the PISA tests, we ranked a tepid 36 out of 79 (1)
In this project, I will look at student achievement and potential issues. 

### 2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?  
What is compelling about the obvious question of the educational lag in performance is that the United States spends a great deal on education. From the NCES report in 2016, "The United States spent $13,600 per FTE student at the elementary/secondary level, which was 39 percent higher than the average of OECD countries3 reporting data ($9,800)" (2)

### 3. What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer? 
- Which areas of the country are performing best in education?
- What areas of the country have performed worst in education?
- What areas of the country have shown improvement?
- What areas  

### 4. Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?**  
(US Education Datasets Unification Project)[https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project]
(US Education Datasets)[https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project]
### 5. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units do you expect to analyze? 
- Direct focus on the US, with possible specific focus on areas within DC/Maryland/Virginia area. 

### 6. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis?
- Achievement Data
- Test scores
- Enrollment data

### 7. What kinds of techniques do you you plan to use (for example, summary statistics, scatter plot, bar chart, chi-squared test)?  
- Summary Statistics, to take a brief look at the data
- Plotting of relevant statistics within the dataset
- Heat map showing collinear correlations (In the US, does higher enrollment % equal higher test scores, etc.)
