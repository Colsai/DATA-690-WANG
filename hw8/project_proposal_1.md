### 1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
I have a wide-range of topics I that am interested in, but as I work in education, I would like to focus on current educational progress for K-12 students. Despite the obvious wealth of the US, as a country, there is much evidence suggesting that our educational attainment lacks in comparison to other countries.  

What fascinates me about the US educational system is its performance. In 2019, on the international Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests, the US ranked a disappointing 36 out of 79 (1). However, when PISA ran its first iteration, the US was 11th out of 12 nations. 

Have students as a whole improved in the US, in comparison to other countries? Have we experienced significant challenges because of higher enrollments? Is a change in funding positively affecting student performance? I hope to reflect on these exploratory questions in this project. 

### 2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?  
Especially with the growing budgetary difficulties incurred by the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, where states are projecting significant declines in state revenues, it is
important to think about to what effect this might have on schools.   

Maryland alone, for example, is projecting an 11-14% budgetary decline in FY 2021 (2), and with the increased difficulties of maintaining fair and equitable education through a
virtual model, it is especially important to think about the potential negatives that students may face in terms of performance based on n/s/l revenue and budgetary shortfalls. 

If there is ever a time to think about "Does more money mean better education?" it is now. What is compelling about the obvious question of the educational lag in performance is that the United States already spends a great deal on education. From the NCES report in 2016, "The United States spent $13,600 per FTE student at the elementary/secondary level, which was 39 percent higher than the average of OECD countries3 reporting data ($9,800)" (3) At the same time, there is a major contrast in the success of students, as outlined by math PISA scores outlined earlier.   

In this project, I will look at student achievement and potential issues within states, looking to identify high and low-performing states, and issues/successes over time in
regards to performance data, funding data, enrollment data, and see what different changes might correlate to higher math/reading scores.   

### 3. What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer? 
- Which areas of the country are performing best/worst in education?
- Which areas receieve the most funding? Is this reflected in student performance?
- What are some larger trends from 1993-2018 in terms of student performance?
- What are some larger trends in terms of funding?
- What are some larger trends in terms of student enrollment?
- Are there correlations between these different variables? (ex. has higher funding per student meant (funding/student total) greater achievement per year?

### 4. Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?**  
- [US Education Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project)
- [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/TablesLibrary)

### 5. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units do you expect to analyze? 
- Direct focus on the US, with possible specific focus on areas within DC/Maryland/Virginia area. 
- I'd like to analyze funding, enrollment, test performance data, by state, by year (10-20 years worth, though there appear to be significant gaps in the dataset) 

### 6. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis?
- Enrollment Information, by state
- Funding Data (National/State/Local)
- Achievement Data/Performance Data
- Test scores by year of math and reading/by grade
- Secondary statistics, like funding per student

### 7. What kinds of techniques do you you plan to use (for example, summary statistics, scatter plot, bar chart, chi-squared test)?  
- Summary Statistics, to take a brief look at the data.
- Plotting of relevant statistics within the dataset.
- Heat map showing collinear correlations (In the US, does higher enrollment % equal higher test scores, etc.).
- Charts and visualizations, showing findings.
- Other exploratory measures that I will plan to learn as I explore.
